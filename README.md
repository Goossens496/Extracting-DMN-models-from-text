# Extracting-Decision-Model-and-Notation-models-from-text-using-deep-learning
This repository contains the following files of the study to extract decision models from text using deep learning:
* Datasets
  * All sentences
     * test_dependency (testset)
     * train_dependency (train set)
  * Conditional sentences
    * test_dependency (testset)
     * train_dependency (train set)
  * Dependency sentences
    * test_dependency (testset)
     * train_dependency (train set)
  * Text Classification:
    * test_dependency (testset)
     * train_dependency (train set)
 * Decision Model Extractor Tool

The datasets are provided in a CSV format. For the text classification datasets, each sentence is provided with the according label. 
For the dependencies datasets, each sentence is also labelled according to the tagging scheme discussed in the paper.
